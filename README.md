# TowersSource - A FREE bloxflip version of auto tower. No webhook or BS.

Source code is here.

Notes: Get token from local storage in f12 and also must be run in python ( no BS ) 
Tip: You dont need bloxflip open in your browser to work.

You should have a lot of robux to do this https://bookmakers.net/betting-tools/martingale-calculator/

Fork this shit if you want to and if I ever make more autobets for other gamemode it will cost $$$
